## What are we making?
* Autonomous **SmartRover** that is designed to explore foreign terrain and its environment.
* The rover predefined mission tasks via web interface and execute as scheduled.
* Self-navigate during the mission with automatic obstacle avoidance logic built-in if there are any unforeseen obstables.

## Why are we making it? What problems does it solve?
* Gather scientific data since the foreign environment is not possible for humans to go there yet.
* Since there is communication delays between Mars and Earth, it is more suitable to plan and 
* Fully utilize SmartCar software library capabilities for demonstration
* The unknown terrain should serve as a great testing ground for obstacle avoidance logic

## How are we going to make it?
* SMCE-Godot to emulate the Martian terrain environment
* Website with interface to define mission objectives and tasks
* Utilize MQTT to communicate with the Rover and receive back mission status reports upon completion
* Generate mission reports and deliver to the user through the website and email
